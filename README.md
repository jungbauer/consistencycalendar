# Consistency Calendar
Application to visualise habit consistency.

### Notes
I'm using this to refamiliarise myself with coding after spending a prolonged amount of time focusing on writing my masters thesis.

Also exploring JPA. It's more abstracted & automated than I'm accustomed to. Previously I was writing SQL query statements and parsing records. 

### Tech
- Spring Boot
- Gradle
- Java 11
- Thymeleaf - HTML templates
- H2 - database
- JPA - Persistence API
- Spock - testing

### Ideas / ToDo
- User profiles
- Spring Security
- ngrok - so I can hit this from my phone without other server.
